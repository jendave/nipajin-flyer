	\noindent
	This scenario for 2 to 6 characters uses the rules from the other side.

	Decide upon a city, a criminal organization and a time period, for example the Mafia in New York during the 1950s or the Yakuza in contemporary Osaka. Your characters are \keyword{petty crooks}, forced to work as a group by the local \keyword{Big Boss} -- the Game Master. Each character has a name, a brief description and uses the d4 as \HD. During the game, you try to outrival and overcome the other characters to become the right-hand man of the Big Boss.

	The game takes place over several \keyword{episodes} that span a week each. Each episode, the Big Boss assigns a job to the group, for example a heist, an abduction, or collecting protection money. It doesn't matter if those jobs succeed, but they set the stage on which the characters compete with each other. Each episode, each player can attempt to harm one other character with style and reduce his \HD\ by 1. Overcome characters leave the city at the end of the week.

	Once per game, characters that feel mistreated may visit the Big Boss to \keyword{ask for a favour}. Their players pick a \AD, and if they roll 4+, their plea was heard. The Big Boss sends his goons to beat everyone up who harmed that character in this week (-2 on their \HD). If the roll is failed, however, the pleaing character gets beaten up instead.
