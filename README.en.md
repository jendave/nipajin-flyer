## Introduction

A NIP'AJIN Flyer is a pen'n'paper roleplaying game that fits on two A6 pages. The first page contains a summary of the rules / dice mechanics of [NIP'AJIN](https://ludus-leonis.com/en), the second page a short scenario. Each flyer is self-contained and can be played as is.

## About the repository

In this repository you will find ...

* `flyer/` contains the LaTeX sources for all flyer RPGs.
* `fonts/` contains all necessary fonts.

## Dependencies

You will need [LaTeX](www.latex-project.org), a typographic system that is based on text files. The flyers use `xelatex` and are tested using TeX Live under Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04 and Cygwin. Makefiles and scripts require some kind of Unix. With a little effort, those scripts should also work on Windows.

## Contributing

If you would like to help by correcting or translating flyers, please make sure you start from the `develop` branch, create a feature branch and submit a pull request. Please take care that you have a good commit history and self-explaining commit messages.
